# Check Server 

While exploring svg animations, i decided to make a page where you can "sorta" check a server status (more like a page status really) by inserting a valid url and will change the svg color based on the response received where it could be either green (ok or responsive) or red (not ok or unresponsive). 

This is achieved by using javascript ajax calls even though is not perfect by any mean.

There is also a coffeescript version of the code.
